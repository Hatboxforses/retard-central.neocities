      <h7>Hello, world!</h7><br>
      <h8>Jazz Jackrabbit was a game series developed and published by Epic MegaGames in August 1st 1994 that<br>
      featured Jazz Jackrabbit an anthropomorphic hare that goes up against a turtle by the name of "Devan<br>
      Shell" that kidnaps princess Eva Earlong. The 2nd game follows this story up with Jazz and his siblings<br>
      Spaz & Lori trying to get Eva's stolen wedding ring. Unfortanately the 3rd game never got a release<br>
      because of the inability to find a publisher. The 3rd game was actually meant to be a third-person<br>
      shooter with platforming and adventure game elements" with the mouse being used to aim & the<br>
      keyboard being used to move as you could probably guess the game was made to be 3d with the<br>
      alternate title Jazz Jackrabbit 3D: Adventures of a Mean Green Hare & the inclusion of the mouse to the<br>
      control scheme. There were no games released after the 3rd game's cancellation & only Epic Games<br>
      knows why (probably Fortnite).
