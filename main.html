      <h7>Hello, world!</h7>
      <h8>Jazz Jackrabbit was a game series developed and published by Epic MegaGames in<br>
      August 1st 1994 that featured Jazz Jackrabbit an anthropomorphic hare that goes up<br>
      against a turtle by the name of "Devan Shell" that kidnaps princess Eva Earlong. The<br>
      2nd game follows this story up with Jazz and his siblings Spaz & Lori trying to get Eva's<br>
      stolen wedding ring. Unfortanately the 3rd game never get a release because of the<br>
      inability to find a publisher. The 3rd game was actually meant to be a "third-person<br>
      shooter with platforming and adventure game elements" with the mouse being used <br>
      to aim & the keyboard being used to move as you could probably guess the game was<br>
      made to be 3d with the alternate title Jazz Jackrabbit 3D: Adventures of a Mean Green<br>
      Hare & the inclusion of the mouse to the control scheme. There were no games<br>
      released after the 3rd game's cancellation & only Epic Games knows why (probably<br>
      Fortnite).
