      <h7>Hello, world!</h7>
      <h8>Jazz Jackrabbit was a game series developed and published by Epic MegaGames in August 1st 1994 that<br>
      featured Jazz Jackrabbit an anthropomorphic hare that goes up against a turtle by the name of "Devan Shell"<br>
      that kidnaps princess Eva Earlong. The 2nd game follows this story up with Jazz and his siblings Spaz & Lori<br>
      trying to get Eva's stolen wedding ring. Unfortanately the 3rd game never got a release because of the<br>
      inability to find a publisher. The 3rd game was actually meant to be a third-person shooter with platforming<br>
      and adventure game elements" with the mouse being used to aim & thekeyboard being used to move as<br>
      you could probably guess the game was made to be 3d with the alternate title of the game Jazz Jackrabbit<br>
      3D: Adventures of a Mean Green Hare & the inclusion of the mouse to the control scheme. There were no<br>
      games released after the 3rd game's cancellation & only Epic Games knows why (it was probably because of<br>
      Fortnite).
